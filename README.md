# 🏗️ Smart Approval System

**🔐 Role-Based Multi-Level Workflow Engine | Django Backend Project**

---

## 🚀 Overview

Smart Approval System is a Django-based enterprise workflow engine designed to manage structured approval processes within an organization.

The system implements:

- 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- 🏢 **Hierarchical Organization Structure**
- 🔄 **Multi-Level Approval Workflow**
- 📊 **Task Lifecycle Management**
- 📝 **Audit-Ready Decision Tracking**

It simulates real-world internal approval engines similar to enterprise systems used in corporate environments.

## 🧠 System Architecture

```
Organization → Team → User
```

The architecture ensures:

- ✅ Organization-level data isolation
- ✅ Team-based hierarchy
- ✅ Secure authentication & authorization
- ✅ Structured approval routing

---

## 👥 User Roles

| Role | Icon | Responsibility |
|------|------|---|
| **EMPLOYEE** | 👨‍💼 | Create approval requests |
| **MANAGER** | 🧑‍💼 | Review and approve/reject tasks |
| **ADMIN** | 🛡️ | Full system-level control |

---

## 🔄 Workflow Logic

1. **Employee** submits approval request
2. **Primary approver** (Manager/Admin) is assigned
3. **Optional secondary approver** added
4. **ApprovalAssignment** tracks each decision
5. **Task status** updates automatically
6. **Dashboard** dynamically reflects task states
7. **In-app notifications** alert relevant users
